I have this urge to die
Another plane to the other side
Look at my life
Nothing left inside

All my frustrations
I could not find a release
My death will come
At great ease

I've felt i've never belonged
Doesn't matter when i'm dead and gone
Life is no longer a wheel
It's time to give you the real deal

From the cradle to the grave
I've never had my way
No one will miss me anyway

The method will be of my own design
Don't be sad at what you're going to find
Got tired of hurting in this world

I don't want to live anymore
Watch myself spill out on the floor
Really it's all for the best
Finally, I can get my rest
